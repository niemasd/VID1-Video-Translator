# Factor 5 VID1 Video Translator
On the Nintendo GameCube, some video files were stored in the [Factor 5 VID1](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/Factor_5_VID1) format, which constituted a `.vid` file in the [Factor 5 VID1 ***container*** format](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/Factor_5_VID1#Container_format) that contained a video stream in the [Factor 5 VID1 ***video codec***](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/Factor_5_VID1#Video_codec). The ***container*** format has already been [implemented into `librempeg`](https://github.com/librempeg/librempeg/blob/master/libavformat/vid1.c), meaning compiling `librempeg` (and thus `ffmpeg`) from the latest source enables support for it. The ***video codec***, however, has not been.

The Factor 5 VID1 ***video codec*** is [very similar to MPEG-4 ASP](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/Factor_5_VID1#Video_codec). Based on these similarities, [`vid1_to_m4v.py`](vid1_to_m4v.py) takes as input a VID1 `.vid` file, and it ***translates*** (no re-encoding!) the video stream into a standard MPEG-4 Visual Elementary Stream `.m4v` file. You can then compile `ffmpeg` from the latest source code to remux the translated video stream from the `.m4v` file and the original audio stream from the `.vid` file into a desired output container (e.g. `.mkv`).

This seems to work for a good number of VID1 files, but there are many files this approach is incompatible with. To truly archive these videos, we need a proper VID1 video codec decoder (rather than my translator) so we can decode VID1 video streams into a lossless format (e.g. [FFV1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFV1)).

# Usage
Basic usage of the [`vid1_to_m4v.py`](vid1_to_m4v.py) is as follows (and full usage details can be viewed using the `-h/--help` argument):

```bash
python3 vid1_to_m4v.py -i original.vid -o translated.m4v
```

This will translate the video stream of the input VID1 file `original.vid` into the output file `translated.m4v`. It will ***not*** copy the audio stream into the output file: just the translated video stream.

# Full Pipeline
The intended full pipeline to go from a GameCube VID1 file to a playable MKV file is as follows.

## Compile Latest `ffmpeg` from Source
The latest `librempeg` (and thus `ffmpeg`) source supports the VID1 ***container***. We won't be using `ffmpeg` to extract the video stream (we'll be using [`vid1_to_m4v.py`](vid1_to_m4v.py) for that), but we *will* be using `ffmpeg` to extract the audio stream. Thus, we first need to compile `ffmpeg` from the latest source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/librempeg/librempeg.git
cd librempeg
./configure --prefix="$PWD/build" --enable-agpl --disable-debug
make -j8
make install
```

There might be other dependencies that you need to install as well. You can Google your compile error messages as needed.

## Translate VID1 Video Stream to M4V
We will first use the [`vid1_to_m4v.py`](vid1_to_m4v.py) script to translate the VID1 video stream into an M4V file:

```bash
python3 vid1_to_m4v.py -i original.vid -o translated.m4v
```

This does ***not*** re-encode the video stream: it's directly translating it from VID1 to M4V.

## Remux Translated Video Stream and Original Audio Stream
Next, we will use the source-compiled `ffmpeg` to remux the translated video stream with the original audio stream.

```bash
./build/bin/ffmpeg -i translated.m4v -i original.vid -c copy -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 remuxed.mkv
```

This does ***not*** re-encode the video or audio stream: it's directly remuxing them into an MKV container.
